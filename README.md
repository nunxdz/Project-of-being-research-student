# Project of being research student
I developed a simple gesture recognition system with Neuron MOCAP using HMMs
Allowing users to input gesture commands instead of mouse and keyboard
With collecting motion data from Neuron MOCAP over 300 samples and then using this data to train a motion gesture recognition model based on hidden markov model.
The goal is to develop simple gesture recognition application which can open some windows software by itself (Paint,Notepad,Calculator)
