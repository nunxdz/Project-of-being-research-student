## Research student's project
I developed a simple gesture recognition interface with **[Perception Neuron(PN)](https://neuronmocap.com/)** MOCAP using **[Hidden Markov Models(HMMs)](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/541428/Sequence-Classifiers-in-Csharp-Part-I-Hidden-Marko)**. 
This interface,  allowing users to input gesture commands instead of mouse and keyboard
With collecting motion data from PN over 300 samples and then using this data to train a motion gesture recognition model based on HMMs from Accord.NET framework. 
**The goal** is to develop simple gesture recognition application which can open some windows application by itself(Paint,Notepad,Calculator)
